(If name of author is not mentioned, it's a note written by me. There can be some typo irrespective of authors. The blue leters contains link of the pdf/texfiles.)
 
- **Algebraic Topology**
   * Simplicial and Singular homology, their equivalances by *Acyclic model theorem* and furthers-[pdf](main.pdf) (This is a part of my VSRP 2023 report).
   * Fixed-point theorems (*Lefschetz*) and Jordan seperation theorem (generalization of *Jordan curve theorem*)-[pdf](fp-ord.pdf) (This is also a part of my VSRP 2023 report).
   * Cohomology and Poincare duality-[pdf](chompoin.pdf).
- **Algebra**
   * Kunneth Formula and Eilenberg-Zilber Theorem-[pdf](kunneth.pdf). 
- **Topology and set theory** 
  * Uncountable ordinals - [pdf](ordinalnumber.pdf).
  * One point compactification and an example with \\( \omega_1 \\)-[pdf](oneptcpt.pdf). 
  
  (These two were written in 1st year summer break)

- **Analysis and convex geometry**
  * **Analysis III** course notes (Latexed by me and my friends)- [pdf](https://awnathan1893.github.io/Analysis3_Notes/pdfs/Analysis-3.pdf) and [here](https://awnathan1893.github.io/Analysis3_Notes/) you can find lecture wise notes.
